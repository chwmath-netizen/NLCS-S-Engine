## On the Nature of *S-Engine Lite* (Why This Is a Degraded Version)

This document presents **S-Engine Lite**, which should be understood **not as a simplified or beginner-friendly version**, but as a **deliberately degraded derivative** of the full S-Engine.

The term *degraded* is used here in a **technical and structural sense**, not as a value judgment.

------

### What “Degraded” Means in This Context

S-Engine Lite preserves the **core mechanical laws** of the original engine:

- √n-based speed scaling
- Circulation thresholds and internal injury logic
- Realm and Heart Method penalty rules
- Skill Cost–based energy consumption
- HP / Internal Energy damage distribution

However, it **intentionally removes entire layers of decision-making and systemic pressure** that exist in the full engine.

This is not simplification by explanation.
This is **reduction by omission**.

------

### What Is Intentionally Removed

Compared to the full S-Engine (advanced simulation versions), S-Engine Lite omits:

- Time manipulation and circulation speed scaling
- Real-time simultaneous combat resolution
- Chaos / melee debuff systems
- Battlefield dominance effects caused by higher-realm interference
- AI decision layers (resource saving, countering, escalation)
- Sustained Footwork maintenance costs tied to total Internal Energy
- Combo pressure and focus incentives
- Economic pressure loops (consumption, recovery, attrition)
- BM-linked constraints and recovery incentives
- Environmental and hunting-ground feedback systems

As a result, **combat outcomes can be calculated**,
but **combat intentions and adaptive behavior cannot be observed**.

------

### Structural Consequence

S-Engine Lite answers the question:

> “Who wins under these rules?”

But it does **not** answer:

> “Why did this character choose to fight this way, at this moment, under this pressure?”

That dimension only exists in the full engine.

In this sense, S-Engine Lite functions as a **reference observation model**, not a complete simulation.

------

### Correct Terminology

Calling S-Engine Lite a *downgrade* would be misleading, as it implies a weaker or inferior version.

The accurate description is:

> **A degraded reference model**

It retains correct rules, correct math, and correct relationships,
while **intentionally discarding higher-dimensional control, timing, and decision layers**.

------

### Intentional Design Choice

This degradation is **deliberate**.

S-Engine Lite exists to:

- Expose the skeleton of the system
- Allow external experimentation
- Invite independent reconstruction and extension
- Prevent direct access to the full decision architecture

Those who attempt to “optimize” or “rebalance” S-Engine Lite will inevitably discover missing degrees of freedom.

That discovery is expected.

------

### Final Note

S-Engine Lite is not meant to be complete.
It is meant to be **provocative**.

Those who take it apart may find something interesting.
Those who try to rebuild it may realize what is missing.

Either outcome is acceptable.
