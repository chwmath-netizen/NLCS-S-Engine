## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the technical whitepaper and proof-of-concept simulators for **NLCS (Natural Language Constraint System)**.
NLCS is a novel methodology that transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) from probabilistic generators into consistent **"Semantic Engines" (S-Engine)** using structured narrative rules, without traditional coding.

## 2. Live Demo (Try it now)
You can run the S-Engine simulators directly in your browser. These simulators are generated purely based on NLCS rules.

* **Combat Simulator (v8.4):** Validates real-time combat logic and vector gravity fields.
* **Growth Simulator (v2.0):** Validates economic balance and long-term resource planning.

## 3. Core Documents
* **📄 [Technical Whitepaper v2.1 (English)](./NLCS_S_Engine_Whitepaper_v2.1_EN.pdf)**: Comprehensive theory including Vector Gravity Field and Margin Collapse.
* **📄 [기술 백서 v2.1 (Korean)](./NLCS_S_Engine_Whitepaper_v2.1.pdf)**: 한국어 원문 백서.
* **🤖 [AI Consensus Report](./Cross_AI_Evaluation_NLCS_S_Engine_EN.pdf)**: Independent evaluation by GPT-5.1, Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3.0.

## 4. Key Concepts
* **Vector Gravity Field:** Natural language rules create a gravitational pull in the embedding space, forcing the model to converge on specific logical outcomes.
* **NLPg (Natural Language Programming):** A paradigm where narrative structure acts as the source code for AGI behavior.
* **Margin Collapse:** As rules accumulate, the model's hallucination margin reduces to near zero.
