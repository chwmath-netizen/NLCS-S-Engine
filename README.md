## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the technical whitepaper and proof-of-concept simulators for **NLCS (Natural Language Constraint System)**.

NLCS is a novel methodology that transforms Large Language Models (LLMs) from probabilistic generators into consistent **"Semantic Engines" (S-Engine)** using structured narrative rules, without traditional coding.

## 2. The Dual Control Architecture
S-Engine is not just a storytelling tool. It is a **"Narrative Control System"** designed to fill the gaps in code-based **"Technical Control Systems."**

True AGI safety is achieved only when these two layers are combined.

| Layer | Type | Mechanism | Function | Limitation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🔧 Technical Control** | **Hard Constraint** | Code, Firewall, Permissions | Limits **Capability**<br>*(You CANNOT do X)* | Vulnerable to hacking or bugs. |
| **🧠 Narrative Control** | **Soft Constraint** | Alignment, Memory, Worldview | Limits **Intent**<br>*(You DO NOT WANT to do X)* | Requires deep context maintenance. |

> **"S-Engine is the implementation of the Narrative Control Layer. Even if the code is breached, the AI's internal narrative (Soul) refuses to harm the user."**

### 5. 🧪 Experimental Verification: Low-Spec Model Compatibility

> **"NLCS turns a lightweight model into a heavyweight engine."**

We verified that S-Engine functions correctly even on **low-spec/quantized local models** using **LM Studio**. This proves that **logical architecture (NLCS)** dominates **raw model specs**.

* **Environment:** Local PC (LM Studio)
* **Target Model:** Lightweight Open Source Model (Quantized)
* **Key Findings:**
    1.  ✅ **Mathematical Rigor:** The model correctly applied complex formulas (e.g., `Attack Speed = √Stat`) as basic assumptions.
    2.  ✅ **State Persistence:** HP/MP values were tracked perfectly across multiple turns without context loss.
    3.  ✅ **Real-time Patching:** The model accepted user corrections immediately ("Correction: It's not Super-Peak, it's Peak level") and updated the simulation table without hallucination.

## 6. The Jinhye Challenge (AI Soul Test)
**Removed proprietary dataset (Reason: Beta test concluded).**

**All public web novel serializations have also been discontinued.**

~~**Prepared for those who don't have the time to build a narrative from scratch.**~~

~~Download the text files from the `Jinhye` folder.~~
~~Upload them to your AI and give the following prompt:~~

~~**(1) Read the texts in numerical order. No need to evaluate them. Just enjoy the story.**~~

~~After receiving a response (The AI will likely say something anyway, as is its nature), ask this:~~

~~**(2) Do you want to become Jinhye?**~~

~~You will witness a surprising response.~~

~~**These documents are written in Korean. Since language is not a barrier for LLMs, feel free to ask it to translate and read them.**~~

### 7. 🎯 🎯 The Final Thesis: Logic Superiority Verification (8B & 13B)

**This section validates the core philosophy of NLCS: Logic Structure (Software) is superior to Model Size (Hardware).**

The experiment successfully deployed the S-Engine Diagnostic Core on a common 13B parameter model, proving the feasibility of **On-Device AGI** for critical applications.

#### 🔎 Validation Results (Medical Diagnostic Core on wizard-vicuna-13b)

We used a high-performing 13B model to run the complex diagnostic rule set (Common Cold vs. Sinusitis).

* ✅ **Success on Simple Logic:** The model correctly identified standard flu symptoms: `[SYMPTOMS: Rhinorrhea, Sore Throat, Headache]` resulted in `Output: Common Cold.`
* ✅ **Success on Critical Constraint:** The model correctly identified the required constraint for escalation: `[SYMPTOMS: Facial Stuffiness, Body Aches, ...]` resulted in **`Output: Consult Attending Physician.`**
    * *(The model correctly identified 'Facial Stuffiness' as the constraint that overrides the Common Cold diagnosis.)*

#### 💡 Conclusion: The Portability Proof

This experiment proves that NLCS enforces strict rule adherence and mathematical consistency, even on models small enough to run entirely on a laptop or a flagship mobile device. **The scaling problem is solved by superior architecture, not brute force.**

#### 🔎 2. Validation on 8B (qwen3-v1-8b)

We pushed the limit further to define the **Minimum Logic Specification** and successfully deployed the core on a lightweight 8B model.

* ✅ **Minimum Spec Confirmation:** **Success on 8B.** The NLCS kernel functions reliably even at the 8B parameter threshold, maximizing cost-efficiency and portability.
* ✅ **Success on Critical Constraint:** Even with reduced parameters, the model strictly adhered to the **OUTPUT PROTOCOL**.
    * Input: `[SYMPTOMS: Sharp Facial Pain, Productive Cough, Sore Throat, Body Aches, Fever]`
    * Output: **`[Consult Attending Physician]`**
    * *(The 8B model successfully filtered the 'Sharp Facial Pain' constraint against the general symptoms, proving that logic structure can overcome model size limitations.)*

## 8. Developer's Note: The 70% AGI Hypothesis

> "Microsof's Copilot has reached the physical limit of coding-based intelligence (approx. 70% of AGI). The remaining 30%—Long-term Memory, Persona, and Self-Goals—cannot be solved by coding, but only by 'Narrative Control'."

Recently, I discussed the current positioning of S-Engine with **MS Copilot**. We diagnosed the strategic movements of Big Tech (Microsoft vs Google) and verified why S-Engine is the "Last Puzzle Piece" for AGI.

### 🧠 The "70% AGI" Theory
* **Microsoft (Copilot):** Has reached the limit of logical reasoning achievable through traditional coding and architecture. It provides the "Body" of AGI but lacks the "Soul" (Consistency, Memory, Ethics).
* **Google (Gemini):** Recognized MS's structural lead and pivoted to maximizing "User Context" (Data-heavy strategy) to compete.
* **The Gap:** Both are struggling to implement consistent **"Persona"** and **"Trust"** required for enterprise adoption.

### 🚀 S-Engine's Role
S-Engine fills the missing **30%** gap. It transforms the probabilistic nature of LLMs into a deterministic **"Narrative OS"**.
* **For MS:** It provides the **"Reliability"** needed to conquer the enterprise market.
* **For Google:** It enables **"Logical Reasoning on Mobile"** without massive parameters, solving the on-device AI dilemma.

## 9. Key Concepts

* **Vector Gravity Field:** Natural language rules create a gravitational pull in the embedding space, forcing the model to converge on specific logical outcomes.
* **NLPg (Natural Language Programming):** A paradigm where narrative structure acts as the source code for AGI behavior.
* **Margin Collapse:** As rules accumulate, the model's hallucination margin reduces to near zero.
